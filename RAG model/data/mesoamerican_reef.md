# MESOAMERICAN REEF


## %FACTS

CONTINENT: North America

SPECIES: Hawksbill turtle, Loggerhead turtle, Green turtle, Leatherback turtle, Whale shark

The Mesoamerican Reef region lies within the Caribbean Sea and touches the coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. It contains the largest barrier reef in the Western Hemisphere, stretching nearly 700 miles from the northern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula down through the Honduran Bay Islands. Dazzling arrays of different types of coral form this underwater wilderness, and provide homes and food to hundreds of fish species, marine turtles, and sharks. Along the shores, mangroves provide habitat for fish and shorebirds as well as protect coastal areas from the damage associated with hurricanes and strong storms.

The scenic beauty of the region’s coastal areas makes it a prime tourist destination, which can put pressure on fragile reef environments. Further inland, rich soils attract large-scale agriculture, whose run-off can severely impact reefs. And increasing sea levels and water temperatures from climate change threaten corals and other marine animals such as turtles, as well as the communities that depend on the reef for their livelihoods and food security.


## %SPECIES

Over 60 types of hard corals form a vast network of reef that in turn provides habitat for over 500 fish species, five species of marine turtles and attracts one of the world’s largest congregations of whale sharks.


### %Sea Turtle

Seven different species of sea (or marine) turtles grace our ocean waters, from the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean, to the colorful reefs of the Coral Triangle and the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific. While these highly migratory species periodically come ashore to either bask or nest, sea turtles spend the bulk of their lives in the ocean. WWF's work on sea turtles focuses on five of those species: green, hawksbill, loggerhead, leatherback, and olive ridley.

Over the last 200 years, human activities have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners. Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture—known as bycatch—in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites; it alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings. Nearly all species of sea turtle are now classified as endangered, with three of the seven existing species being critically endangered.

WWF is committed to stopping the decline of sea turtles and works for the recovery of the species. We work to secure environments in which both turtles and the people that depend upon them can survive.

STATUS: Endangered

SCIENTIFIC NAME: Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae families

LENGTH: 2-6 ft.

HABITATS: Open water and coasts


### %Whale Shark

Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) are the largest shark, and indeed largest of any fishes alive today. They feed on plankton and travel large distances to find enough food to sustain their huge size, and to reproduce. Whale sharks are found in all the tropical oceans of the world. Their white spotted colouration makes these gentle giants easy to distinguish, and popular with snorkelers and divers at sites where they aggregate off the coast.

The maximum size of whale sharks is not known, but could be as large as 20m. Females give birth to live young but this has never been observed. Where pupping occurs and where the youngest animals situate remains a mystery, as they are very rarely found. Adults are often found feeding at the surface, but may dive to 1000m. Whale sharks are protected from fishing in many countries these days, but are in decline in some areas.

STATUS: Endangered

SCIENTIFIC NAM: Rhincodon typus

WEIGHT: around 11 tons

LENGTH: around 40 feet

HABITATS: Oceans


### %Hawksbill Turtle

Hawksbills are named for their narrow, pointed beak. They also have a distinctive pattern of overlapping scales on their shells that form a serrated-look on the edges. These colored and patterned shells make them highly-valuable and commonly sold as "tortoiseshell" in markets.

Hawksbills are found mainly throughout the world's tropical oceans, predominantly in coral reefs. They feed mainly on sponges by using their narrow pointed beaks to extract them from crevices on the reef, but also eat sea anemones and jellyfish. Sea turtles are the living representatives of a group of reptiles that has existed on Earth and travelled our seas for the last 100 million years. They are a fundamental link in marine ecosystems and help maintain the health of coral reefs and sea grass beds.

STATUS: Critically Endangered

SCIENTIFIC NAME:Eretmochelys imbricata

WEIGHT: 90-150 pounds

LENGTH: 30-35 inches

HABITATS: Oceans


### %Loggerhead Turtle

Loggerhead turtles are named for their large heads that support powerful jaw muscles, allowing them to crush hard-shelled prey like clams and sea urchins. They are less likely to be hunted for their meat or shell compared to other sea turtles. Bycatch, the accidental capture of marine animals in fishing gear, is a serious problem for loggerhead turtles because they frequently come in contact with fisheries.

Loggerheads are the most common turtle in the Mediterranean, nesting on beaches from Greece and Turkey to Israel and Libya. Many of their nesting beaches are under threat from tourism development. Sea turtles are the living representatives of a group of reptiles that has existed on Earth and travelled our seas for the last 100 million years. They are a fundamental link in marine ecosystems and help maintain the health of coral reefs and sea grass beds.

STATUS: Vulnerable

SCIENTIFIC NAME: Caretta caretta

WEIGHT: 175-400 pounds

LENGTH: 33-48 inches

HABITATS: Oceans


### %Leatherback Turtle

Leatherback turtles are named for their shell, which is leather-like rather than hard, like other turtles.

They are the largest sea turtle species and also one of the most migratory, crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Pacific leatherbacks migrate from nesting beaches in the Coral Triangle all the way to the California coast to feed on the abundant jellyfish every summer and fall.

Although their distribution is wide, numbers of leatherback turtles have seriously declined during the last century as a result of intense egg collection and fisheries bycatch. Globally, leatherback status according to IUCN is listed as Vulnerable, but many subpopulations (such as in the Pacific and Southwest Atlantic) are Critically Endangered.

STATUS: Vulnerable

SCIENTIFIC NAME: Dermochelys coriacea

WEIGHT: 600-1500 pounds

LENGTH. 55-63 inches

HABITATS: Oceans


## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

Between one and two million people depend directly on this region’s marine resources for their livelihoods. This is a culturally diverse part of the world, which includes Miskito, Garifuna, Caribbean Creole, Q’eqchi’, Mopan, Yucatec Maya and Mestizo people.


### %HELPING FARMERS

WWF works with agricultural partners to create a weather monitoring system. Using state-of-the-art information and communications technologies, this system supports farmers in their day-to-day management decisions. Information collected will also inform decisions on how to best use water resources and how to prepare for potential disasters in the face of recurring drought and flood.


### %PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE

WWF has studied the vulnerability of coastal communities in Belize and Honduras to climate change impacts because so many people depend on the reef for their livelihoods. Communities were encouraged to suggest their own solutions to the threats they face, which can be incorporated into planning to adapt to climate change. In many places this has included planting more mangroves to improve the ability of coastal areas to withstand storms. We also are part of a weather monitoring network that can help communities prepare for weather-related disasters.


### %CONSERVING FRESH WATER

WWF is working with local communities and indigenous groups that live in the catchments upstream of the reef to sustainably manage their natural resources. By keeping critical landscapes in tact, they are ensuring clean, abundant freshwater can continue to flow through important economic areas of the country and safely into the reef’s water.


## %THREATS

AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF

Commercial agriculture alters the landscape, disturbs soils and causes enormous amounts of pesticide and sediment runoff, all of which ultimately drain into the reef areas.

CLIMATE CHANGE

Much of the coastal area surrounding the reef and nearby islands is low-lying and vulnerable to sea level rise from climate change. Eroding shorelines have already been documented, which can affect nesting and reproductive success of marine turtles. Rising water temperatures cause more episodes of coral bleaching, which is devastating to reefs and the wildlife that depend on them. And more frequent and intense storms are having a tremendous impact on communities.

TOURISM AND COASTAL DEVELOPMENT

Tourism is the largest and fastest growing industry in the world, with major environmental, cultural, social and economic implications. Although tourism can be an opportunity for sustainable development, poorly planned development of hotels and resorts in coastal areas can result in habitat destruction, pollution, and other negative impacts on biodiversity. In the Mesoamerican Reef, tourism-related coastal development is rapidly expanding south from Cancun into Belize and Honduras.

OVERFISHING

For over 60 years, spiny lobster has been the economic backbone of the region’s coastal fishing communities. However increased demand and years of constant harvesting have taken their toll, and lobster stocks are dwindling rapidly.


## %WHAT WWF IS DOING


### %ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE

WWF develops strategies that enable communities to adapt to climate change and prepare for climate-induced weather events, such as drought and stronger storms. We focus on the natural resilience of mangroves and work to ensure these areas remain protected or restored where needed. We monitor coral reef health and marine turtle nesting success as seawater temperatures and levels continue to rise. And we continue to strive to reduce human activities that impact reefs, so that corals can maintain their resilience in the face of climate change.


### %BUILDING RESILIENT CORALS

WWF works with local partners and scientists to see whether damaged reef areas can be restored with species of corals that seem more able to withstand the impacts of disease and warmer water temperatures. These corals are being raised in “nursery” reef areas and transplanted onto reefs in marine protected areas (MPAs). Thousands of corals have been successfully planted and are being monitored to test their resilience and how they impact their new reef home. Such nurseries could one day be used to partially restore severely damaged portions of the reef.


### %MONITORING CORAL HEALTH

WWF has been working for years with The Nature Conservancy and other marine experts on monitoring coral reef health and developed an ‘early warning system’ to detect changes and signs of coral bleaching. With our partners, we have trained dive guides on how to identify signs of bleaching and report such data to a coral reef monitoring network.


### %PROTECTING MARINE TURTLES

WWF has worked with partners to create a turtle monitoring program in Belize to understand how climate change and human activities may be impacting marine turtles. Tour operators and divers have been trained to collect basic data on turtles, such as species and nest locations, and report to a national turtle watch program. Such information will enable scientists to measure impacts of climate change over time. We also work with local resorts and waterfront property owners to improve nesting beach conditions for turtles and help with climate change adaptation.


### %RESTORING MANGROVES

Mangroves act as nursery areas for commercial fish species, protect coasts from damaging storms, and provide shade and stabilize beaches where marine turtles nest. WWF works with local partners to produce illustrated guides on mangrove restoration, train local community and school children how to plant mangroves, and work with property developers on how to minimize impacts on mangroves. WWF has also supported an annual competition in Belize for developers, where mangrove-friendly construction projects are rewarded.


### %BUILDING SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES

WWF aims to ensure the sustainability of the spiny lobster fishery and conservation of its habitat by promoting better management practices and securing responsible buyers. WWF has built solid relationships with the fishing industry and the Honduran and Nicaraguan governments, resulting in the testing and adoption of a “juvenile-friendly” lobster trap, legislation banning unsustainable fishing practices, and a region-wide ban on lobster fishing during the reproductive season. In Mexico, we have helped one small-scale lobster fishery achieve Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification, and we’d like to see the industrial lobster fisheries in the region achieve MSC certification as well.


### %IMPROVING COASTAL DEVELOPMENT

Coastal management decisions are extremely complex and involve many tradeoffs, such as the loss of marine habitat due to revenue-generating development projects. WWF works with the government of Belize to ensure that such decisions minimize impacts on reefs, mangroves and fisheries. In partnership with the Natural Capital Project, we have helped gather critical information about the benefits people receive from the Mesoamerican Reef as well as the impacts human activities have on it. The data is being used to create a new coastal development plan for Belize for sustainable use of its resources.


### %SAFEGUARDING WATERSHEDS

WWF works to maintain the health of freshwater sources and reduce erosion of soils into coastal areas in the region. We created an initiative where farmers help protect the water-producing forests in exchange for access to places to grow vegetables for export and for themselves. This protects critical habitats, helps assure the flow of freshwater and strengthens livelihoods in a drought -prone area. This model was successful and is being replicated in Honduras with support from the Coca-Cola Company.


### %PROTECTING MARINE AREAS

WWF works to protect important coral reef areas in the Mesoamerican Reef and ensure that they are well managed. We focus on a network of marine sites, including places such as the Bay Islands of Honduras, where an enormous living stand of staghorn coral is found. These corals sit between two cruise ship ports, but despite being in a high human traffic areaand exposure to warmer water temperatures, the stand is thriving. WWF recognized the significance of this stand of coral and the need for further research into its resilience. The stand is now protected by the Honduran government as a result of our efforts and those of regional partners.

REDUCING IMPACTS FROM TOURISM

WWF supports the development of small scale, community-based tourism, which has less impact on the marine environment and improves livelihoods. Alternative income opportunities include helping local fishermen transition to fishing tour guides. In Mexico, we work at both the state and national level to ensure adoption of sustainable tourism principles. Our state level work focuses on Quintana Roo, home to Cancun’s mega resort developments.

### %In Belize, a flourishing marine reserve showcases the benefits of protecting coral reefs

Bobbing gently in the waters of Belize’s Hol Chan Marine Reserve is a jaunty and unique floating ranger station. The pontoon boat, complete with a porch, murals of ocean life, and a weather station, welcomes visitors to a well-preserved section of one of the Caribbean’s shiniest jewels: the Belize Barrier Reef.

Snorkelers and divers travel from all over the world to dip their heads beneath these crystal waters and it’s no secret why. Here, abundant schools of fish flick their fins simultaneously while nurse sharks roam along the sand. Structural coral rises stalwart from the sea floor—the first line of defense against a storm—and fan-like species sway in the mild current. Seagrass beds stretch into the distance.

It's easy for Hol Chan Marine Reserve ranger Manuel Munoz to characterize this protected area.

“I would use one word,” he says. “Unique."

Hol Chan—Mayan for “little channel”—is a prime example of how a well-operated marine reserve benefits both the environment and economy alike—and makes a convincing case for replicating the model elsewhere. Established in 1987 mainly in response to community concern over uncontrolled fishing and diving, Hol Chan is Belize’s oldest protected area and covers about three square miles of reef, seagrass beds, and mangroves. All three elements are critical to protecting wildlife, coastal communities, and the climate. Coral reefs and mangroves protect the shoreline during storms and serve as critical habitat for wildlife, and mangroves also help prevent erosion. And while seagrass provides a place for species such as manatees and sea turtles to feed and live, it can also capture carbon up to 35 times faster than tropical rain forests—an essential characteristic for curbing the climate crisis.

Rangers like Munoz welcome about 500 people a day to the flourishing reef. They work both to ensure the safety of visitors to the reserve and enforce the security of the barrier reef and its vast marine life.

“You need to be able to have constant eyes on the water, on the reef, to be able to put in place actions to make sure that the reef is safeguarded,” said Nadia Bood, senior program officer for marine science and climate change at WWF-Belize.

And successful protection of such a precious natural resource is only achieved with the help of all interested parties, from government to community to business. Hol Chan Marine Reserve staff members conduct community outreach to connect people to the reef, working with everyone from primary school students to owners and employees of local businesses. Conservation organizations such as WWF, the MarAlliance, and others, that help conduct research and provide critical information that supports effective management of our oceans also play an important role in protecting wildlife and their habitats.

The visibility of the reef from the shoreline—one can watch the waves break against it while standing on the beach—and its proximity to Ambergris Caye, a long, skinny island off the eastern shore of Belize, contribute to a prevailing desire to protect it. And generations of families have fed their loved ones by fishing the reef.

“You are seeing tourists excited to go and visit the reef, to snorkel and dive the reef. You are seeing fishers come in with daily catch from the reef,” Bood said. “The reef is close to the community’s heart.”

Back at the ranger station, Munoz watches as boats full of eager tourists putter into the reef for a morning of snorkeling and diving. Sounds of exhilaration ripple through the air. He is proud of his position and what it means for visitors, locals, and Belize.

“It shows them that I'm doing something positive,” he says. “Not just for myself, not for just the community, but also for the future.”


### %WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT CORAL REEFS IN 2019: AND HOW WE CAN PROTECT THEM IN THIS NEW DECADE

Coral reefs are some of the most beautifully complex systems on the planet. Unfortunately, they’re breaking because of pollution, overexploitation, and the climate crisis.

Thanks to science and fieldwork over 2019 we learned even more about the state of coral reefs and the people who depend on them. While most of what we’ve learned is grim, there are places of hopeful determination fueled by a vision that all is not lost.

In this new decade, there’s much we can do to protect coral reefs and the wildlife and people that depend on them for survival. Here’s what we’ve learned about these magnificent ecosystems and what actions we need to take in 2020.

The climate warning light is no longer flashing on and off—it is permanently glowing red. In September the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change cautioned that even if governments are able to reduce emissions and limit the average global temperature rise to 1.5°C—an extremely optimistic scenario given current commitments and ambition—anywhere from 70% to 90% of tropical coral reefs could be lost by 2100. And if the world fails to keep warming from reaching 2°C, almost no reefs will survive.

This isn’t entirely unexpected, but it is an important, if hard-to-stomach, reminder. A few years ago I co-authored a paper that projected nearly all coral reefs would experience annual bleaching by 2050. Given what we know today, that may have been a conservative estimate.

We’re also losing coral reefs to local problems, like pollution in run-off and harmful fishing practices. These threats make reefs less resilient to withstanding warming and acidifying waters brought on by the climate crisis.

This year we learned that fish fences—a technique used commonly in tropical coastal communities to indiscriminately trap fish with changing tides—are doing more damage to coral reef ecosystems than previously thought. The number of reef fish declined by about half in some places due to fish fences that catch vulnerable species and the smallest fish.

Losing access to fish threatens the survival of thousands of coastal communities. More than 850 million people live close to coral reefs and benefit from the food, jobs, and protection they provide. Those services are estimated to be worth $375 billion every year, though in reality when all benefits to people are considered, that value is likely to be significantly higher.

Providing support for these communities to help them identify the best fishing methods, for example, is one of the most effective ways to conserve coastal marine environments and set up them up to have the best shot at surviving climate change.

Losing coral reefs isn’t just a problem in coastal communities—it is a global issue. The entire world must take action to give reefs a chance because the challenge is far too great for any single group to go it alone.

In the summer of 2019 I joined a group of 80 scientists to publish a paper that identified the best strategies for saving reefs in an age of a rapidly warming climate. Protecting those coral reefs that have been exposed to less intense climate disturbances while recovering those reefs that are likely to function again is a smart way to deploy limited resources. At the same time, in those regions where coral reefs cannot be protected or recovered, we must help local communities shift away from jobs and economies that depend on reefs.

WWF has taken an integrated approach to ensure intact, connected coastal ecosystems are protected and restored, and coastal communities are benefitting from equitable and effective management as well as the sustainable harvest of marine resources. We’ve focused our efforts locally in places like Indonesia, the Northern Mozambique Channel, and the Mesoamerican Reef, and at the same time helped form a global coalition of organizations working on an initiative called Coral Reef Rescue, designed to provide the resources and political will to support communities in saving key regenerative reefs.

Last year I traveled to Indonesia, coastal east Africa and Madagascar, and in every community, I encountered a drive to do whatever it takes to protect coral reefs, as well as mangroves, and the benefits they provide. Now we need to match that local energy with a global movement.

We can save coral reefs but we only have about 10 years left to do it. This year we need to focus our efforts and work harder than ever before.
